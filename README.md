# Saving Issue + Quest data
When creating Issues, had to choose an unused save ID that didnt clash with existing ones:
Eg
```
public class HeadmanNeedsHardWoodIssueTypeDefiner : SaveableTypeDefiner
    {
        // Ensure the number in the base() is unique
        public HeadmanNeedsHardWoodIssueTypeDefiner() : base(1000500)
        {
        }
        
        protected override void DefineClassTypes()
        {
            base.AddClassDefinition(typeof(HeadmanNeedsHardWoodIssueBehavior.HeadmanNeedsHardWoodIssue), 1);
            base.AddClassDefinition(typeof(HeadmanNeedsHardWoodIssueBehavior.HeadmanNeedsHardWoodIssueQuest), 2);
        }
    }
```
